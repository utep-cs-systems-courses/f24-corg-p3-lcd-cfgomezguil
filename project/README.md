# Project from Project 3: Heart Attack
## Introduction
This game is made to just be a simple game to provide some mindless
#entertainment. Once the project starts running. go ahead and use the S1
#button to plot the current heart in the heart specified. You can check the
#color and heart that will be plotted by looking at the bottom to see their
#condition. The Number relates to the heart that will be drawn (1 -> top, 2 ->
#middle, 3 -> bottom) and the color that is contained in the box will show the
#color that heart will be done. To change the color and the heart drawn, press
#S2. To change only the heart state, press S3.
